      welcome to your staff page.....<br />
                        We teach our children to share, to cooperate, to play nicely– to be good citizens who work together to make their world a better place. In business, we emphasize teamwork, encourage community spirit, and build relationships. Yet the traditional picture of teaching is an insulated classroom where teachers are left alone to do their jobs, with an emphasis on individualism and isolationism. Why don’t we make it easier for our children’s teachers to have the same opportunities that we demand for our children and in our professional lives? Teachers often aren’t given the opportunity to collaborate with their peers, and (I would argue) they, perhaps more than any other professionals, benefit from professional collaboration and support. And, by extension, the children benefit as well.
